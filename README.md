## Description:

In this assessment, I have implemented the Bank Balance calculation for the customers satisfying all the requirements, handling all exceptions and getting the desired output. This code will work for input format mentioned in the assessment.

I have implemented this project by following different Design Pattern concepts and principles like "Program to interface and not implementation".

Datastructure: I have used ArrayList datastructure to store the data that is being read from bankJustWorks.csv file. 

ArrayList has an advantage of not mentioning the size of ArrayList, which satisfies my need to store the input data read from the file until EOF.

I'm using add(Object) method of ArrayList to add an element at the end of the ArrayList, which has time complexity of O(1).

This ArrayList is then itereated through to store modified data into a hashmap.

Then I calculate the minimum, maximum and Total balance of each customer for the given month of transaction and display it in terminal and output file.

I have included the input file with sample input data.
